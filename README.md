# MPT, The Efficient Frontier, and LSTM's
## An open source project by Jacob Somer
### Goals of this project
1. Get historical stock market data programatically through an API
2. Forecast daily stock prices and covariance using Long Short Term Memory Networks
3. Visualize the efficient frontier and discover new insights in the art of Stock market prediction
